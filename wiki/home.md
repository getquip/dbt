# Welcome to the **dbt Wiki**  

This wiki serves as the central knowledge base for **dbt**, documenting its architecture, design principles, and best practices as we move forward with the platform.  

## ðŸ“Œ **Why DBT?**  
DBT transforms the way we build and manage data models by providing a more structured, DAG-driven approach that increases efficiency and clarity. This helps ensure that models are organized and materialized according to their purposeâ€”whether report-ready or intermediate.  

## ðŸ“– **What Youâ€™ll Find Here**  
- **DBT Overview** â€“ Key concepts and goals behind the platform.  
- **Project Structure & Naming Conventions** â€“ How models are organized and categorized.  
- **Best Practices** â€“ Guidelines for building, optimizing, and maintaining models.
