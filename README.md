This dbt project is designed to transform raw data into actionable insights. By leveraging modular SQL and robust transformations, it ensures data consistency, quality, and readiness for analytics.

## Getting Started  

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**  
    A virtual environment isolates your project dependencies from the system Python installation, preventing version conflicts and ensuring a consistent development environment.
   
   Run the following command in your terminal to set up a virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**  
   Use the appropriate command for your operating system:  
   - On macOS/Linux:  
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```  
   - On Windows:  
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required packages by running:  
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
