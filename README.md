#### Poetry for Python
Poetry is a Python dependency management tool that allows us to manage your projectâ€™s dependencies, packaging, and publishing with ease. Follow the steps below to install and set up Poetry on your local machine.

**Prerequisites**
Python 3.10+ should be installed on your system. You can check your Python version with:
```bash
python --version
```

If you need to install Python, follow the official [Python installation](https://www.python.org/downloads/) guide.
Next, follow the official guide for [Installing Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**  
    A virtual environment isolates your project dependencies from the system Python installation, preventing version conflicts and ensuring a consistent development environment.
   
   Run the following command in your terminal to set up a virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   poetry env use python3.10
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**  
     ```bash
     eval $(poetry env activate)
     ```  =

3. **Start your Virtual Environment**  =
   ```bash
   eval $(poetry env activate)
   ```

### Instructions on how to set DBT_GCP_BQ_DATASET:


   To make this change persistent across terminal sessions, you need to update your `~/.zsh_profile` or `~/.zshrc` file (whichever file is sourced by your shell).

   1. Open the appropriate file in a text editor:

   ```zsh
   nano ~/.zsh_profile
   ```
   2. Update `DBT_GCP_BQ_DATASET` to `your_name`. Then save the file and confirm changes.

   3. After updating the file, run the following command to apply the changes.

   ```zsh
   source ~/.zsh_profile
   ```

   Or

   ```zsh
