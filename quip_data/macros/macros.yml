macros:
  - name: generate_schema_name
    description: |
      Generates a custom schema name based on the execution environment.
      - In development (`dev`), the schema name is prefixed with the `profiles.yml` dataset name.
      - In production (`prod`), the schema name remains as defined in `dbt_project.yml`.

      This macro is inherently called whenever running `dbt run`, `dbt build`, or `dbt seed`, 
      ensuring models materialize in the correct schema.
    arguments:
      - name: custom_schema_name
        type: string
        description: "The base schema name as defined in dbt_project.yml."
      - name: node
        type: dictionary
        description: "The dbt node object, used for accessing runtime context."

  - name: generate_database_name
    description: >
      The purpose of this macro is to dynamically generate database names based on the dbt target. If the target is prod, the database name will be quip-dw-stage. If the target is dev, the database name will be quip-dw-stage-dev.
  - name: generate_hashed_pii_fields
    description: >
      The purpose of this macro is to hash PII fields in a dataset. This is useful for GDPR compliance. 

  - name: get_max_partition
    description: |
      This macro retrieves the maximum value of a specified partition field from the current model table.
      It can also accept an optional `where_clause` to filter the rows before retrieving the maximum value.
    arguments:
      - name: partition_field
        description: |
          The field/column on which the `MAX()` function is applied.
          Typically, this is a timestamp or a partition key.
        type: string
      - name: where_clause
        description: |
          An optional SQL WHERE clause to filter the rows for the `MAX()` calculation.
          If not provided, the entire table is considered.
        type: string
      - name: lookback_window
        description: |
          An optional lookback window to consider when calculating the maximum value.
        type: string
    description: |
      Determines the appropriate BigQuery project based on the environment.
      - In production (`prod`), the project name remains unchanged.
      - In development (`dev`), the project name is appended with `_DEV` to ensure models are written to the dev environment.

      This macro is inherently called whenever running `dbt run`, `dbt build`, or `dbt seed`, 
      ensuring models materialize in the correct database.
    arguments:
      - name: custom_database_name
        type: string
        description: "The base project name as defined in dbt_project.yml."
      - name: node
        type: dictionary
        description: "The dbt node object, used for accessing runtime context."

  - name: drop_untracked_tables
    description: |
      This macro identifies and drops tables that are not tracked by dbt in the target project.
      It first checks for untracked schemas and drops them entirely if they are not found in the dbt project.
      If a schema is tracked, it then checks for untracked tables within that schema and drops them individually.
      
      **Important:**
      - This macro should **only be used in production**. It is **not set up for custom dev schemas**.
      - Use the `dry_run` argument (`dry_run=True`) to preview which schemas and tables would be dropped before executing actual deletions.
    arguments:
      - name: dry_run
        type: boolean
        description: |
          If `True`, the macro will log the schemas and tables that **would** be dropped instead of actually executing the deletions.
          If `False`, the macro will drop untracked schemas and tables from the database.
      
          Example: dbt run-operation drop_untracked_tables --args '{dry_run: true}'
