      tags: ['daily']
    columns:
      - name: insert_id
        description: The unique identifier for the table.

      - name: reference_id
        description: |
          The `reference_id` is a polymorphic key. 
          When the order is a DTC (Direct-to-Consumer) order and `code = 'Shipment'`, 
          the `reference_id` represents the shipment ID. This ID can be linked back to the 
          `orders` table via `orders.newgistics_shipment_id`. Despite the name, 
          `newgistics_shipment_id` is not a Newgistics field; it reflects a backend naming convention.
