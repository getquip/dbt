      Staging table for Wen Parker shipment details. This table contains information about shipments, 
      including tracking numbers, transportation details, weight, volume, and delivery dates.
      This table is loaded daily with new shipment data from the source system and is deduplicated
      because Wen Parker sends multiple records for the same shipment.
